# Datacamp-projects

I started using DataCamp in June, 2023. Since then, I've learnt a lot about data manipulation, data preprocessing, python programming and machine learning. I dedicated this repo to share the projects that I'm doing at DC.

Please feel free to comment, I'm happy to take your advices and suggestions.
