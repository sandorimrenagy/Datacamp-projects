# Datacamp-projects

I started using DataCamp in June, 2023, I dedicated this repo to share the projects that I'm doing there. Since then, I've learnt a lot about data manipulation, data preprocessing, python programming and machine learning.

Please feel free to comment, I'm happy to take your advices and suggestions.
